<question>Why create a DAO ?<question>
<answer>A DAO is a way to collectively manage resources in a community, in a way that is fair, transparent,
and participatory. Instead of relying on top-down decision making, a DAO is led by a community. Founders put in funds and receive shares. As the DAO grows, new members are voted in, and members can receive shares for work, funds, or whatever else the community decides. Members can make proposals and vote. DAOs tend to be more creative, collaborative, agile, and fair.
&nbsp;
You might choose to make a DAO to collectively decide which projects your community will develop, or to reward active members with NFT's for their contributions. Homebase is a platform designed to empower communities to create and run DAOs on Tezos.

Here are a few articles about why the cooperative decentralization of web3 is relevant to creators, startups, and anyone wants to see a more fair and open internet:

Tezos Homebase was developed for the Tezos community to organize and develop DAOs together. Over time, Homebase will add features based on common needs as more Tezos communities create DAOs. The future of DAOs is bright, as more and more developers, creators, and protocols are utilizing the power of DAOs to build community engagement and realize the peer-to-peer benefit of blockchain innovation.

<question>How do you create a DAO?<question>
<answer>
## **The social side of DAO’s**
&nbsp;
While Homebase empowers you to create a DAO for your community to collectively manage resources together on-chain, it’s up to you to decide how your community is governed.
&nbsp;
For example, do you have social processes connected with how you make decisions, such as dialogue, a recurring cadence of meetings to talk through, any agreements on how you are achieving your mission together?
&nbsp;
You might find this [DAO Canvas](https://github.com/DAOresearch/dao-canvas) resource helpful for communicating transparently with your community how you organize together.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## **Tokens**
&nbsp;
To create a DAO on Homebase, your community needs to have a token. Tokens give members voting rights. DAOs typically have two types of membership tied to tokens: **token-based memberships**, where members govern a decentralized protocol together and can purchase tokens through liquidity pools or decentralized exchanges; and **shares-based memberships**, where a DAO is pooling financial resources to fund development, charity, or investments.
&nbsp;
Governance tokens can be 1:1, one membership one vote, or they can be allocated according to reputation, where community members earn tokens through contributing to DAO, and their voting power is proportional to their investment of time, money, labor, or other kinds of resources.
&nbsp;
Please note that on Tezos you cannot use an NFT token as your voting token.

<question>How to create a DAO on Homebase<question>
<answer>
Here’s a step-by-step walkthrough of how to configure your DAO in Homebase.
&nbsp;
Watch this video, or read the description below.
&nbsp;
[![Homebase DAO - Creating a DAO on Tezos](how_to_create_dao_on_tezos.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15-zGGXwCc "Homebase DAO - Creating a DAO on Tezos")
&nbsp;
From the homepage, [https://tezos-homebase.io/](https://tezos-homebase.io/), click on Enter App.
&nbsp;
From here you will Create DAO.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
Connect your wallet to proceed. 
&nbsp;
There are two types of DAOs on Homebase. Treasury DAOs and Registry DAOs. Select which one is the type of DAO you are creating. The most common type of DAO is a Treasury DAO, to collectively manage shared resources, so this tutorial will walk you through that.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
Next, you will configure the DAO settings. We’ll walk you through what each of these terms means as we go.

&nbsp;
**Token address** is the smart contract address of the token that your community uses to pool assets. If you have not yet created one, you will need to. You don’t need to be a smart contract developer to do this. You can use the [FA2 bakery](https://fa2-bakery.netlify.app/).
&nbsp;
Please note, you cannot use an NFT token for voting on Homebase. If you enter an NFT token on this screen, your DAO will fail to complete at the end of the creator. You must have or create a token using the FA2 standard.
&nbsp;
**Token ID** In Tezos’ FA2 token standard, one token address can have multiple IDs. For example, you might have one token that is for one sub-set of voters to vote on a specific aspect of an organization, and another for a different subset. Or you might have different tokens that have different utility functions.
&nbsp;
**DAO Name** Usually this is your community’s name.
&nbsp;
**Token Symbol** the abbreviation for your token, as set up when you created your FA2 token.
&nbsp;
**Description** What does your community do with this DAO? This is most often a one-line description of your community. Here’s an example of how it shows up in the end:
<answer>


<question>What is a registry?<question>
<answer>A registry is a token-curated list of anything that DAO chooses. Examples might include marketplaces, a map of highly ranked places, or approved companies for placing ads on a blockchain-based media network. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## **How does it work?**
&nbsp;
A person or entity who wants their offering placed on the list, stakes tokens to the DAO to apply. A setting is configured in the DAO for how long the application is in the queue before it is automatically approved. During this time, any member of the DAO (they are curators in this case) may choose to challenge the application. This triggers a vote among curators. If the application is rejected, the applicant forfeits their deposit, which is then split between the challenger and the curators who voted to reject the proposal. If the application is accepted, the challenger’s deposit is split between the applicant and the curators who voted to accept.
