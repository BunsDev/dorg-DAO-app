<question>Why create a DAO ?<question>
<answer>A DAO is a way to collectively manage resources in a community, in a way that is fair, transparent,
and participatory. Instead of relying on top-down decision making, a DAO is led by a community. Founders put in funds and receive shares. As the DAO grows, new members are voted in, and members can receive shares for work, funds, or whatever else the community decides. Members can make proposals and vote. DAOs tend to be more creative, collaborative, agile, and fair.
&nbsp;
You might choose to make a DAO to collectively decide which projects your community will develop, or to reward active members with NFT's for their contributions. Homebase is a platform designed to empower communities to create and run DAOs on Tezos.

Tezos Homebase was developed for the Tezos community to organize and develop DAOs together. Over time, Homebase will add features based on common needs as more Tezos communities create DAOs. The future of DAOs is bright, as more and more developers, creators, and protocols are utilizing the power of DAOs to build community engagement and realize the peer-to-peer benefit of blockchain innovation.<answer>

<question>What is a registry?<question>
<answer>A registry is a token-curated list of anything that DAO chooses. Examples might include marketplaces, a map of highly ranked places, or approved companies for placing ads on a blockchain-based media network. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## **How does it work?**
&nbsp;
A person or entity who wants their offering placed on the list, stakes tokens to the DAO to apply. A setting is configured in the DAO for how long the application is in the queue before it is automatically approved. During this time, any member of the DAO (they are curators in this case) may choose to challenge the application. This triggers a vote among curators. If the application is rejected, the applicant forfeits their deposit, which is then split between the challenger and the curators who voted to reject the proposal. If the application is accepted, the challengerâ€™s deposit is split between the applicant and the curators who voted to accept.
